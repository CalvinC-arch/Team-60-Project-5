# Team-60-Project-5

How to Compile and Run Team 60 Project 5:

The code can be easily compiled using the IntelliJ IDE utilized by the team for the creation of the code. To run the project on one device, simply download and compile all the
project .java files. First, run ProfileServer.java. Once this is running, run ProfileClient.java. This will autoconnect to the localhost at the right port number and allow access
to the program. To run the project on multiple devices, select one device as the 'server' and one device as the 'client'. The 'server' device should have the following files, at
minimum: Account.java, IOMachine.java, Profile.java, ProfileClientHandler.java, ProfileServer.java, and ViewProfile.java. The 'client' device should have the following files, at
minimum: Account.java, EnterInfoGUI.java, FriendsListGUI.java, IOMachine.java, LoginPageGUI.java, Profile.java, ProfileClient.java, and ViewProfile.java. To start the server, run 
ProfileServer.java. For the client, edit line 26 of ProfileClient.java to contain the IP address of the server. Then, run ProfileClient.java.
